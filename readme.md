Use python to interact with the Musixmatch API for song lyrics

### Prerequisites

* [Python3](http://www.python.org/downloads)
* [Musixmatch Developer Account](https://developer.musixmatch.com/)

### Installing

1. Download and put the two python files in the same folder somewhere

2. Install requests from terminal

```
pip install requests
```

3. Enter you API key inside of the api request

4. Run lyrics.py

### Menu options

1. EXAMPLE: Search for the lyrics of a song
0. Exit

NOTE: Only the first few lines of the lyrics will be returned as we have to pay money for the premium version which will return the full lyircs. As it was just a fun project i haven't paid.
However, if you have paid for it you would get the full lyrics if you use your API key.
